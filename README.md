# Unit-1-Homework
Code was provided to me for the purpose of condensing and refactoring.

There were many instances of redundant classes in the CSS stylesheet provided as well as broken links in some of the HTML file. 

These errors have been fixed and the code has been refactored to use less lines on the style sheet.
